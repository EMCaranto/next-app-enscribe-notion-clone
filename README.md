## Setup

- #### Clone the Repository

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   `git clone https://github.com/EMCaranto/next-app-enscribe-notion-clone.git`

- #### Environment File

2.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

3.  Add the necessary environment variables to the `.env` file.

        This is the required environment variables:

        CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT =
        CLERK_SECRET_KEY =
        EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY =
        EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY =
        NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL =
        NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY =

- #### Install Dependencies

4. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using `npm` or `yarn`:

   `cd your-repository-directory`

   `npm install` or `yarn install`

- #### Start the Development Server

5. Start the development server to run the project locally:

   `npm start` or `npm run dev`

The project should now be running locally, and you can access it in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another specified port if applicable).

## Status

**Enscribe** is currently under development, although it is fully functional. I plan to update the UI soon and introduce additional features beyond basic editing and sharing capabilities, including real-time collaboration. Furthermore, I will focus on enhancing and resolving any minor bugs in the system.
